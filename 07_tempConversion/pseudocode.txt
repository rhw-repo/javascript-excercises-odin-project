1. Create function, call it ftoc, give it (number) as argument
	
2. Convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius, store the result in a variable called result; formula to convert is [°C] = ([°F] − 32) × 5⁄9 
(5/9 is fraction, can convert to decimal by dividing 5 by 9 which is 0.55555555555556 or use it as 5 / 9)
  
3. Round off value of result to one decimal place, store in a variable called celcius

4. 32 fahrenheit to celsius should return 0 check ouput in console 
 
5. If correct ouput, return (celcius)
 
6. Call function pass it various degrees farenheit (as numbers) inc with 1 decimcal place, check output in console

7. Copy paste to create another function, change function name to ctof, change variable name farenheight to celcius and vice versa  
 
8. Change code block to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit, store in a variable called result; formula to convert is [°F] = [°C] × 9⁄5 + 32

9. Round off value of result to one decimal place, store in the variable called farenheight

10. 0 celsius to fahrenheit should return 32, check output in console, call function with various numbers 

11. If correct ouput, return (farenheight)

12. Call function pass it various degrees celcius (as numbers) inc with 1 decimcal place, check output in console

13. Delete both function calls to allow test to call and pass values to functions
