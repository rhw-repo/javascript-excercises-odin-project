1. Define parameters: 

// Fibonacci number - a value from the Fibonacci Sequence
// each number is the sum of the two preceeding numbers 
// Fibonacci Sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 
// example: 4th value in Sequence is 2 because 1 + 1 = 2
// example: 5th value in Sequence is 3 because 1 + 2 = 3


// Accepts strings 
// JavaScript automatic type conversion will convert string to number as 
// adding it to another number during the for loop 

// Rejects negative numbers - set condition 
if (i= <0) return "OOPS";

// Begin calculations from the value 1 in Sequence yet deal with input 0
if (num === 0) return 0;

Input
// the value passed to the function by the test
// corresponds to the index position in the Sequence

Output 
// function return:
// value generated by a for loop by passing in input (index position in the Sequence)
// example, 4th position in Sequence passed in as (fibonacci(4));
// starting from 1, calculates product of 2 preceeding numbers, and passes as num1 to next iteration
// i incremented by 1, calculates product of 2 preceeding numbers (num1 + num2)
// new 'total' passed to next iteration as num1 
// repeats until i is no longer less than input value then returns num1 + num2 stored as num2
