Declare a function called sumAll

Give it the arguments in the parentheses of (num1, num2)


Write a codeblock within the function body {} that: 

	Checks if num1 bigger than num2, if so, swaps them around 
	Checks if input is a not a number (and therefore returns "ERROR")
	Checks if input is a string, which might contain number (and therefore returns "ERROR")
	Returns the sum of every number between(and including) num1 and num2

Call the function via the test (which gives it the parameters I want it to work with).
